     accompanied with the mesmerizing aromas of spices, herbs & caramelized onions.</p>

<h3><i>ingredients needed :</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 large red onions,sliced thin</li>
    <li>200ml of peanut oil for frying</li>
    <li>1kg chicken thighs,skin off</li>
    <li>4 tbsp yogurt</li>

    <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>3 tsp ginger paste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    
<li>Prepare the Fried Onions:<br>

Heat the peanut oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.<br>
Add the thinly sliced onions in batches and fry until golden brown and crispy (8–10 minutes per batch).<br>
Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.<br> 
Set aside half of the fried onions for garnishing.
</li>
<hr>
<li>Marinate the Chicken:<br>

In a large bowl, mix yoghurt, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, ginger paste, garlic paste, salt, and lemon juice.<br>
Add the chicken thighs and mix well to coat.<br>
Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for best results).
</li>
<hr>
<li>Cook the Rice:<br>

In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.<br>
Add the soaked rice, cardamom pods, bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.<br>
Cook the rice until it’s 70% cooked (slightly undercooked).<br>
Drain and set aside.</li>
<hr>
<li>Cook the Chicken:

Heat 3-4 tbsp of the leftover oil (from frying onions) in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat.<br>
Add the marinated chicken and cook for 10–12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is almost cooked through and the marinade thickens.<br>
 Remove from heat.</li>
 <hr>
<li>Layer the Biryani:<br>

In a large pot or deep pan, spread a layer of the cooked chicken at the bottom.<br>
Add half of the rice as the next layer, followed by a sprinkle of fried onions, chopped coriander, and mint leaves.<br>
Add the remaining rice as the top layer.<br> Drizzle with the saffron milk (if using), melted ghee, and a final sprinkle of fried onions.</li>
<hr>

<li>Cook the Biryani (Dum Cooking):<br>
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.<br>
If the lid is loose, seal it with a piece of foil or dough.<br>
Cook on very low heat for 20–25 minutes.<br>
This allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
<hr>
<li>Serve:<br>

Gently mix the layers before serving to distribute the flavors evenly.<br>
Serve hot with raita, salad, or pickle.</li>
